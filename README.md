**Intro**

In both, media and desktop view you can see the wonderful functionality of the gallery view and it's transformations. In the images I have provided, you can also see how adding more text will not have an overflow but a cohesive look in the bio. You may add knew images and captions. This project is made so all the elements are displayed on popular screen sizes.
